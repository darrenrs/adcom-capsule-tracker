# Adventure Communist Free Capsule Tracker

This is a simple tool to assist players of the mobile game Adventure Communist.  The tool allows you to track which type of free capsules you've opened, and predicts the type of the next one.  It can do this because the free capsules are given out in a predetermined cycle.

## How to use

Hosted at: <https://zephyron1237.github.io/adcom-capsule-tracker/>

Click on capsules in the "Add Capsule" section to add them to your history, or the "minus" symbol to remove the last one.  The "Next Capsule" section will automatically update with chances for the next capsule's type, and the "Cycle" section will visually highlight each possibility.  Eventually, you should be able to figure out exactly where you are and reliably predict the future.

## Thanks

Feel free to use this however you want, especially since I will probably won't update the tool for the rest of the game's lifespan, though credit is always appreciated.
